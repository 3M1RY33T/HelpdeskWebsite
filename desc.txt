This project is a .NET-based client-server application designed to 
manage a helpdesk system. It enables users to manage support calls, 
track employee activities, and generate reports on calls and employee
 performance. The application follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller)
 pattern, providing a structured web interface where users can log 
 and monitor support requests, assign tasks to employees, and analyze
 data through generated reports.
